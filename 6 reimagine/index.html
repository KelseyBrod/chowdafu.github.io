<h1>The Interactive Narrative</h1>
</header>

<main>
<div class="intro">

<p>Game studies is a relatively new field in the humanities. The value of approaching video games with humanistic methodologies appears only after video games became popular. As more and more people gain access to--as well as spend significant amounts of time on--video games, the aesthetics of video game emerges. Video games contain increasing amount of cinema clips as the intersections of the storyline, and the video game storytelling is becoming more and more important in the game industry. </p>

<h2>Interactive Narrative that defines how the story goes</h2>
<p>
    The first type of interactive narrative only exist in certain types of video games. By making choices, the player can decide where the story goes. Such interactive narrative aquires the game designer to prepare different storylines of the game, so that the story goes differently as the player chose different options in the gameplay.

<p>Your choices determine where the story goes. Connor may die in the first chapter: The hostage. It will happen if:

    <br>Try to intimidate defect with weapon,
    <br>1)If the negotiations fail (if you don't achieve at least 50-60% chance of success in negotiating on the interface),
    <br>2)If the negotiations fail, and Connor decides to save Emma,
    <br>3)If Connor chooses the 'Sacrifice-self' dialogue option. </p>

<h2>Supplimental Interactive Narrative</h2>
<p>
    The supplimental interactive narrative does not change the storyline of the game. They appears in a non-mandatory way. There is no instruction for the player to find them, players can go through the game without collecting any of them.
